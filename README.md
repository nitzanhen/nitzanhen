### Hi there, I'm Nitzan Hen ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate sotware engineer with expertise in full-stack development, and especially Typescript, React and Node.js.
I'm also enthusiastic about open source software, learning, teaching, writing and linguistics.

Currently studying towards an M.Sc. in Mathematics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

#### ðŸŒ± Current focus
- [rhode](https://github.com/nitzanhen/rhode-releases), a knowledge-building companion app for mathematicians.  
  This is a desktop app built with Electon, TypeScript, React and CodeMirror. 
- [objectmap.js](https://github.com/nitzanhen/objectmap.js), a HashMap implementation for the modern JavaScript world.  
  Its crown feature is comparing keys by value rather than reference. 

#### ðŸš€ Notable Projects
- [agrippa](https://github.com/nitzanhen/agrippa), a CLI for generating front-end component boilerplate automatically.
- [pips](https://github.com/nitzanhen/pips), a tiny library providing type-safe pipes with an elegant syntax.  
  
#### ðŸ§ª Side Experiments
- [crossword](https://github.com/nitzanhen/crossword), a Go project that generates crosswords from an arbitrary corpus.  
- [rubiks-cube](https://github.com/nitzanhen/rubiks-cube), a Three.js project that renders and animates a rubik's cube.  
- [color-projection](https://github.com/nitzanhen/color-projection), a project showcasing a fun application of Linear Algebra, and orthogonal projection in particular.
