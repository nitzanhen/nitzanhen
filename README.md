### Hi there, I'm Nitzan Hen ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate sotware engineer with expertise in full-stack development, and especially Typescript, React and Node.js.
I'm also enthusiastic about open source software, learning, teaching, writing and linguistics.

Currently studying towards an M.Sc. in Mathematics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

#### ðŸŒ± Current focus
- [rhode](https://github.com/nitzanhen/rhode-releases), a knowledge-building companion app for mathematicians.  
  This is a desktop app built with Electon, TypeScript, React and CodeMirror. 
- [objectmap.js](https://github.com/nitzanhen/objectmap.js), a HashMap implementation for the modern JavaScript world.  
  Its crown feature is comparing keys by value rather than reference. 

#### ðŸš€ Notable Projects
- [agrippa](https://github.com/nitzanhen/agrippa), a CLI for generating front-end component boilerplate automatically.  
  There's a lot of improvements and features I'm still looking forward to implement in it, most notably to improve the [VSCode extension](https://github.com/nitzanhen/agrippa-vscode) and simplify the API.
- [pips](https://github.com/nitzanhen/pips), a tiny library providing type-safe pipes with an elegant syntax.  
  While it's production ready, I never got around to spreading its word.
  
#### ðŸ§ª Side Experiments
- [crossword](https://github.com/nitzanhen/crossword), a Go project that generates crosswords from an arbitrary corpus.  
  The motivation for this project originates from a vocabulary-building, language-agnostic app that I'd like to create someday.
- [rubiks-cube](https://github.com/nitzanhen/rubiks-cube), a Three.js project that renders and animates a rubik's cube.  
  The project originates from a side project I had to create an algorithm for solving a Rubik's cube, but I never got around to that part (yet hope to someday).
- [color-projection](https://github.com/nitzanhen/color-projection), a project showcasing a fun application of Linear Algebra, and orthogonal projection in particular.  
  I made it for my students at the Linear Algebra workshop I instructed last year.
